 Common examples of dynamic styling in Vue.js

Practising common use cases for styling can be tricky in Vue.js for first-timers. I have provided examples for v-bind and how it is used with class and style. The examples help you understand how to access and use the event object as well as data properties to dynamically assign classes. I hope you find it useful. Have fun!
